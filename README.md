# SecureHealth dApp

## Purpose
SecureHealth is a dApp designed to securely store and share health records. Users can store their health data in a decentralized network, ensuring privacy and security.

## How It Works
- Users upload their health data, which is encrypted and stored in a decentralized database.
- Users control who can access their data, granting access only to authorized health professionals.
- Health professionals can access and update data as permitted by the user.
- All transactions are transparently recorded and traceable on the blockchain.

## Scenario 1: Scroll Blockchain
**Advantages:**
- High transaction speeds and low fees.
- User-friendly features and integrations.
- Quick support from the developer community.

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower awareness and adoption.
- Less tested in terms of security and scalability.
- Smaller developer community.

## Scenario 2: Ethereum Blockchain
**Advantages:**
- Widely accepted and adopted blockchain.
- Large developer community and many existing dApp integrations.
- Extensively tested for security and scalability.

**Disadvantages:**
- High transaction fees (gas fees).
- Scalability issues, slower transactions during peak times.
- More complex development process.

## Final Choice: Ethereum
**Reason:**
- Given the critical nature of health data security and privacy, Ethereum, a reliable and extensively tested blockchain, is preferred.
- Ethereum's large developer community and existing dApp integrations will support the development and growth of SecureHealth.
- Although transaction fees are high, security and adoption rate are more crucial factors.
